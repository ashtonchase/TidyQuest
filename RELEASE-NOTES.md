# TidyQuest v0.5.0 Release Notes

> **Date:** 2026-04-28

First stable release of the 0.5 series — everything that shipped across the four beta releases, polished and ready for production.

---

## What's new since v0.4.1

### New Features

- **Goal completion tracking** — goals automatically mark themselves as complete when the target coin count is reached; dashboard shows a "Completed!" badge
- **Pre-defined tasks in existing rooms** — add template tasks to rooms you already have, not just during room creation
- **Per-task assignment in the room creation wizard** — assign tasks to household members directly in step 2 of room creation
- **Dashboard task filter** — filter Today's Quests to show only tasks assigned to you
- **Avatar login screen** — click your avatar on the login screen instead of typing a username (#32)
- **Goal coin rewards** — goals no longer silently auto-complete; progress is tracked accurately per-goal period
- **Home Assistant integration** — new `custom_components/tidyquest` package exposes each task as a HA sensor with services: `complete_task`, `create_task`, `update_task`, `delete_task`, `reset_task`, `refresh` (contributed by @C-Blais)
- **Task reset endpoint** — admin-only `POST /tasks/:id/reset` makes a task immediately due again and reverses coins

### Bug Fixes

- **#67**: Countdown timer no longer shows "_h 60m" — minutes calculation fixed
- **#68**: Template task names display translated names instead of raw keys
- **#69**: Template task tap targets fixed on mobile (44px minimum)
- **#70**: Customise modal uses an ✕ close button
- **#71**: Task add form row has minimum height to prevent layout shift
- **#72**: Adding a task with an empty title now shows a validation error
- **#73**: Task edit form auto-focuses the name field; prevents saving with empty title
- **#75**: "Overdue" label aligns correctly with the health calculation
- **#78**: Hamburger menu icon visible in dark/night theme
- **#79**: Username login is now case-insensitive
- **#83**: Multiple goals no longer auto-complete instantly on creation
- **#86**: Customise panel shows "Leaderboard" instead of "This Week" for the leaderboard section
- **#88**: Dashboard titles "Coins Status" and "Reward Requests" now use consistent Title Case
- **#95**: New tasks default to Dirty (0% health) instead of Clean
- **Task assignment layout**: Assign dropdown in room creation moved to its own row — no longer squished into the config grid

### Security

- path-to-regexp 0.1.12 → 0.1.13 (CVE-2026-4867)
- picomatch 4.0.3 → 4.0.4 (CVE-2026-33671, CVE-2026-33672)
- vite 7.3.1 → 7.3.2 (path traversal fixes)
- vite 8.0.0 → 8.0.5 (server.fs hardening)
